# PutinBlock

## Description

PutinBlock is a browser extension that automatically detects and blocks images of Vladimir Putin on the web using advanced facial recognition machine learning algorithms. This is an experimental extension, so please note that running machine learning algorithms can be quite resource-intensive, and the actual detection speed may vary depending on your hardware. Additionally, images smaller than 150px are ignored to avoid false positives.

## Installation

To install PutinBlock, simply download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com).

## Usage

Once installed, PutinBlock will automatically detect and block images of Vladimir Putin on the web. No further setup is required, and you can continue browsing as usual.
